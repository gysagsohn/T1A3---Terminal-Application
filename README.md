Started my project of T1A3 Terminal application
My app idea was approved and this was the brief I submitted:
    Brief - I would like to make a truck register. It will keep a detail for a fleet of trucks, including key information, such as rego, model, and plant number.

    Features will include:
        to add/remove trucks
        to update the data relevant to the truck
        ability to search/sort data by any of its features
        display the register of trucks
        a feature that defines a truck based on its GVM to be LV, MV, HV

Remote Repository
    For my remote repository I have choosen git hub. The first commite was made on 12/12
